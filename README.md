### Introduction:
In this project I created decision tree and random forest classifiers from scratch. The learning algorithm I implemented was the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm, which can use either entropy or Gini index as the impurity measure.

After creating the classifiers, I evaluating the implementations on real datasets, and did model selection to optimize the classifiers to the datasets. Lastly, I com- pared my implementations of the decision tree and random forest classifiers to existing library implementations from sklearn.

### HowTo:
Run the notebook `run_experiments.ipynb` to reproduce the results in my report.

Python libraries used: NumPy and sklearn

The decision tree class is implemented in `decision_tree.py` and the random forest class is implemented in `random_forest.py`.
